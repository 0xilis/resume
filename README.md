# Hi! I'm Snoolie.

I'm an iOS Programmer from Indiana, United States, who's had about a year of experience of Objective-C. I've always had an interest in programming, when I was little I did simple block coding in Scratch [https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Snoolie/](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/zachary7829/), and participated in Computer Science club at my Junior High School & High School. Upon High School, I finally started my first CS classes (excluding some javascript lessons I took in 2nd grade at a library), and learned Python. I also expanded my knowledge upon JavaScript in later CS lessons, and as my final project, made HSF8 (High School Final 8), a CHIP-8 emulator: [https://github.com/0xilis/HSF8](https://github.com/zachary7829/HSF8). My teacher was so impressed by it, hehe. However, I wasn't only learning in school! I made some simple WKWebView frontend apps for some shortcuts related sites [https://github.com/0xilis/WebAppSGallery](https://github.com/zachary7829/WebAppSGallery), and decided to learn iOS development and found my passion. Check out some of my oldest Objective-C projects: [https://github.com/0xilis/Crashia](https://github.com/zachary7829/Crashia), [https://github.com/0xilis/Lightshake](https://github.com/zachary7829/Lightshake). Here's a few I'm exceptionally proud of:

# Badger

Badger is an iOS jailbreak tweak I've released on Havoc for $0.99, coded 100% on Objective-C.

# Pastcuts

Pastcuts is an iOS jailbreak tweak that's free and open source and allows iOS 15+ shortcuts to be imported on iOS 13/14. Source available here: [https://github.com/0xilis/Pastcuts](https://github.com/0xilis/Pastcuts).

# WorkflowKit rev engineering

I've reverse engineered WorkflowKit a ton. Check out [https://github.com/0xilis/RandomShortcutsRev](https://github.com/0xilis/RandomShortcutsRev).

# HSF8

HSF8 is a CHIP-8 emulator made in Python.

# Vulns Found

I've disclosed 3 vulns with Apple's Shortcuts app. CVE-2021-30763 is an internet permission vuln, as well as a vuln for arbitrary write via Extract Archive (link), and, most impactful, a vuln allowing hidden actions (link).
